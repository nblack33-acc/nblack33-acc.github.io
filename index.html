        <h1>Programmable MIDI loopback instrument</h1>
        <p>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          Hello! Today we'll be building a little MIDI player. It has three buttons;<br />
          <ul>
            <li>One that starts & stops recording</li>
            <li>One to select the note - pressing it will repeatedly increase the pitch, cycling through from middle C to B</li>
            <li>One to move to the next note, and (when recording is finished) to play the song.</li>
          </ul>
        <br />
          It also makes use of two other components;
          <ul>
            <li>A piezo speaker for sound output</li>
            <li>An LED to indicate when recording mode is active</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

            <h2>Part 1: Installing the buttons</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>The buttons can be placed anywhere in the center of the breadboard, but should be next to each other</li>
              <li>Either terminal can be used as the ground terminal, but for simplicity, it should be kept consistent between buttons</li>
              <li>It is recommended to make the wires for the GPIO pins different, but similar colors, so that they are easy to recognize as more wires are added</li>
            </ol>
         </p>

            <h2>Part 2: Grounding the circuit</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EK6HE_YnSD0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <br />
            I use brown to differentiate the main ground line from the ground lines within the circuit, on the breadboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>Part 3: Connecting the piezo buzzer</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFZcpffSjHc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <br />
            I use green because it is distinct from both the ground, and other GPIO wires.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>Part 4: Connecting the LED</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlVtma9dthw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <br />I use an extra-long wire here, so that I can keep it separate from the other GPIO wires.
          </p>
          <p>
             <h2>Part 5: Finishing up and Demonstration</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/snOxWmW7Q4g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <br />I ran into a slight issue here, it turned out it was because my elbow had brushed the trackpad on my chromebook. But I resolve it within the video.
            <br /><br /><strong>The code for the project is available, fully commented, <a href="https://nblack33-acc.github.io/final.py">here</a>.</strong>

          You can find a TinkerCAD diagram of the project <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5sIg79zbN2R-fabulous-krunk-tumelo/editel?sharecode=6tsQis22N_7wdYnwUMwwU6fmKroLCo47vZ88-q7I9pk">here</a>, but to be honest, it makes the circuit look more complex than it actually is.<br />
          Since all the components are wired up in parallel instead of in series, if you can wire up an LED, you'll have no trouble with this circuit.<br />
          Effectively, you are connecting 3 buttons, each to a GPIO pin, an LED to a GPIO pin, and a piezo to a GPIO pin. Then, you connect all of their ground pins to a single rail, and that rail to the raspi ground. Couldn't be simpler!
