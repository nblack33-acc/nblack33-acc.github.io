      Hello! Today we'll be building a little MIDI player. It has three buttons;<br />
      <ul>
        <li>One that starts & stops recording</li>
        <li>One to select the note - pressing it will repeatedly increase the pitch, cycling through from middle C to B</li>
        <li>One to move to the next note, and (when recording is finished) to play the song.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It also makes use of two other components;
      <ul>
        <li>A piezo speaker for sound output</li>
        <li>An LED to indicate when recording mode is active</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find a TinkerCAD diagram of the project <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5sIg79zbN2R-fabulous-krunk-tumelo/editel?sharecode=6tsQis22N_7wdYnwUMwwU6fmKroLCo47vZ88-q7I9pk">here</a>, but to be honest, it makes the circuit look more complex than it actually is.<br />
      Since all the components are wired up in parallel instead of in series, if you can wire up an LED, you'll have no trouble with this circuit.<br />
      Effectively, you are connecting 3 buttons, each to a GPIO pin, an LED to a GPIO pin, and a piezo to a GPIO pin. Then, you connect all of their ground pins to a single rail, and that rail to the raspi ground. Couldn't be simpler!
